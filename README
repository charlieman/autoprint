AutoPrint is a tool that prints the given url.

It's meant to be used by associating a `print://` scheme so it can be
called from a website by simply loading a url. The tool will translate
`print://` to `http://` and load it. From there, the user can configure
and print the page.

The use case is in web based invoce systems, so users can avoid dealing
with manually printing the page and without the extra headers usually
added by web browsers.
